#NORG

## Introduction
This project originally started out as a small homage to the most beloved species ;-) in the galaxy.
It however adapted somewhat to humans so I felt it needed a different name.

NORG is an esolang that doesn't try to be as hard as BF or even Malbolge but rather restricts programming in a different way. See the documentation in pdf format. 

I provide an interpreter written in C++, currently source code and windows executable.


## Code

You should compile the source code with C++11 or later. To avoid crashes on large programs, set linker option -Wl,--stack,25000000.
