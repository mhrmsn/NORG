I provide a checksum for the executable so you can check if your download worked.
After downloading you should check the file with an antivirus scanner.
A checksum cannot guarantee that the file hasn't been tampered with
because who is able to change the executable will also be able to change the checksum file.
However, it may be easier (for me) to see if the checksum changed when inspecting the repo...
